      <li>
        For the vanilla custard, pour the milk into a pan with the vanilla seeds
        and vanilla pod and place over a low heat until just simmering. Remove
        from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour together until
        pale and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the vanilla pod from the warm milk. (You can rinse this off to
        use in making vanilla sugar.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the warm milk slowly into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture back
        into the pan and cook over a low heat for 4-5 minutes, whisking, until
        the mixture thickens. (It should be very thick.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and beat in the butter until melted and
        incorporated. Transfer to a bowl, cover the surface with clingfilm to
        prevent a skin forming and leave to cool. Set aside to chill in the
        fridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the jam, tip the raspberries into a deep saucepan with the sugar and
        two tablespoons of water. Cook gently over a low heat, stirring
        occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved. Bring the mixture to the
        boil and boil vigorously for about four minutes, or until the
        temperature reaches 104C/219F on a sugar thermometer. Transfer to a
        heatproof bowl and leave to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the sponge, preheat the oven to 180C/160C(fan)/Gas 4. Grease and
        line the base of a 23cm/9in springform tin with baking parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the eggs and sugar into a large bowl and using an electric mixer,
        whisk together until the mixture is very pale and thick and the whisk
        leaves a trail on the surface when lifted. This will take about five
        minutes.
