          Lomography is the commercial trademark of Lomographische AG, Austria
          for products and services catering to lo-fi photographers. The name is
          inspired by the former state-run optics manufacturer LOMO PLC of Saint
          Petersburg, Russia. LOMO PLC created and produced the 35mm LOMO LC-A
          Compact Automat camera — which became the centerpiece of Lomography’s
          marketing and sales activities. This camera was loosely based upon the
          Cosina CX-1 and introduced in the early 1980s. In 1991, the Austrian
          founders of Lomography discovered the Lomo LC-A.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          They were “charmed by the unique, colorful, and sometimes blurry”
          images that the camera produced. After a series of international art
          exhibitions and marketing, Lomography signed an exclusive distribution
          agreement with LOMO PLC — thereby becoming the sole distributor of all
          Lomo LC-A cameras outside of the Soviet Union. Since the introduction
          of the original Lomo LC-A, Lomography has produced and marketed
          various lines of branded analogue cameras.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          Most of these cameras are designed to produce a single photographic
          effect. In 2005, production of the original Lomo LC-A was
          discontinued. Its replacement, the LC-A+, was introduced in Fall 2006.
          The new camera, made in China rather than Russia, featured the
          original Russian lens manufactured by LOMO PLC. This changed as of
          mid-2007 with the lens now made in China as well. Similar to Eastman
          Kodak’s concept of the “Kodak moment”, the Lomography website endorses
          a motto of “Don’t Think, Just Shoot”.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          This motto is accompanied by the Ten Golden Rules of Lomography;
          guidelines encouraging spontaneity and minimal consideration of formal
          technique. The cameras marketed by Lomography are generally
          low-fidelity and inexpensively constructed. Some cameras make use of
          multiple lenses and colored flashes, or exhibit optical distortions
          and light leaks. Current models marketed by Lomographische AG include
          Lomo LC-A, Diana, Holga, Holga 35mm, Actionsampler, Frogeye, Pop-9,
          Oktomat, Fisheye, Fisheye2, Colorsplash, Colorsplash Flash, F-stop
          Bang, SuperSampler, Horizon 202, Seagull TLR, and Smena 8M.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          The company also resells dead stock Polaroid cameras and Russian dead
          stock. The Lomographic Society International owns galleries, stores
          and “showcases” dedicated to the growth, support and public exposure
          of the art. The society is based in Vienna, Austria, where most of its
          events are organised. An example of the society’s cultural events
          showcasing photographs from the community is the Lomokikuyu
          competition, which raises money for eye surgeries and vision care in
          Kenya, in partnership with Viennese vision aid organisation Light for
          the World.

        <h3 class="mph3" id="Section-2">Section 2</h3>
        <p class="mpp">
          The project has since been updated and donations now also go to the
          International Committee of the Red Cross to help fight the famine in
          East Africa. The organisation also organises the Lomography World
          Congress, an international conference of practitioners held in varying
          host cities. The website also features a magazine, which provides a
          photo archive storage for their work. Articles monitor trends emerging
          in the community and offer tips on. Aficionados of the hobby can blog
          their own tutorials to share their discoveries, fostering enthusiasm
          with the Lomographic art.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          Besides fans who are community members, Lomo Amigos, or friends of
          Lomography, are often celebrities who enjoy working with Lomography
          cameras and are invited to contribute to the magazine. They include
          Elijah Wood, Neil Gaiman, and David Arquette. The site also celebrates
          the work of Lomographers with online exhibits and competitions.
          Digital painting is an emerging art form in which traditional painting
          techniques such as watercolor, oils, impasto, etc. are applied using
          digital tools by means of a computer, a digitizing tablet and stylus,
          and software. Traditional painting is painting with a physical medium
          as opposed to a more modern style like digital.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          Digital painting differs from other forms of digital art, particularly
          computer-generated art, in that it does not involve the computer
          rendering from a model. The artist uses painting techniques to create
          the digital painting directly on the computer. All digital painting
          programs try to mimic the use of physical media through various
          brushes and paint effects. Included in many programs are brushes that
          are digitally styled to represent the traditional style like oils,
          acrylics, pastels, charcoal, pen and even media such as airbrushing.
          There are also certain effects unique to each type of digital paint
          which portraying the realistic effects of say watercolor on a digital
          ‘watercolor’ painting.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          In most digital painting programs, the user can create their own brush
          style using a combination of texture and shape. This ability is very
          important in bridging the gap between traditional and digital
          painting. Digital painting thrives mostly in production art. It is
          most widely used in conceptual design for film, television and video
          games. Digital painting software such as Corel Painter, Adobe
          Photoshop, ArtRage, GIMP, Krita and openCanvas give artists a similar
          environment to a physical painter: a canvas, painting tools, mixing
          palettes, and a multitude of color options. There are various types of
          digital painting, including impressionism, realism, and watercolor.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          There are both benefits and drawbacks of digital painting. While
          digital painting allows the artist the ease of working in an
          organized, mess-free environment, some argue there will always be more
          control for an artist holding a physical brush in their hand. Some
          artists believe there is something missing from digital painting, such
          as the character that is unique to every physically made object. Many
          artist post blogs and comment on the various differences between
          digitally created work and traditionally created artwork. The main
          difference between digital and traditional painting is the non-linear
          process. That is, an artist can often arrange their painting in layers
          that can be edited independently. Also, the ability to undo and redo
          strokes frees the artist from a linear process. But digital painting
          is limited in how it employs the techniques and study of a traditional
          painter because of the surface differences and lack of physicality.
          The digital artist has at their disposal several tools not available
          to the traditional painter. Some of these include: a virtual palette
          consisting of millions of colors, almost any size canvas or media, and
          the ability to take back mistakes, as well as erasers, pencils, spray
          cans, brushes, combs, and a variety of 2D and 3D effect tools.

        <h3 class="mph3" id="Section-3">Section 3</h3>
        <p class="mpp">
          A graphics tablet allows the artist to work with precise hand
          movements simulating a real pen and drawing surface. Even the
          traditional surface has changed for digital painting. Instead of a
          canvas or sketchbook, artists would use a mouse or tablet to display
          strokes that would appear with the touch of a pen to the tablet’s
          surface, or a click of pen. Tablets can be pressure sensitive,
          allowing the artist to vary the intensity of the chosen media on the
          screen. There are tablets with over two thousand different levels of
          pressure sensitivity. The earliest graphical manipulation program was
          called Sketchpad. Created in 1963 by Ivan Sutherland, a grad student
          at MIT, Sketchpad allowed the user to manipulate objects on a CRT
          (cathode ray tube). Sketchpad eventually led to the creation of the
          Rand Tablet for work on the GRAIL project in 1968, and the very first
          tablet was created. Other early tablets, or digitizers, like the ID
          (intelligent digitizer) and the BitPad were commercially successful
          and used in CAD (Computer Aided Design) programs.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          Modern day tablets are the tools of choice by digital painters. WACOM
          is the industry leader in tablets which can range in size from 4” x 6”
          all the way to 12” x 19” and are less than an inch thick. Other brands
          of graphic tablets are Aiptek, Monoprice, Hanvon, Genius, Adesso,
          Trust, Manhattan, Vistablet, DigiPro, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          All these graphic tablets have the basic functions of a mouse, so they
          can be used as a mouse, not only in graphic editors but also as a
          replacement for a mouse, and they are compatible with practically all
          Windows and Macintosh software. The idea of using a tablet to
          communicate directions to a computer has been an idea since 1968 when
          the RAND (Research and Development) company out of Santa Monica,
          developed the RAND tablet that was used to program.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          Digitizers were popularized in the mid 1970s and early 1980s by the
          commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad
          manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. These digitizers were used as
          the input device for many high-end CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems
          as well as bundled with PC’s and PC based CAD software like AutoCAD.
          The first commercial program that allowed users to design, draw, and
          manipulate object was the program MacPaint. This program’s first
          version was introduced on January 22, 1984 on the Apple Lisa. The
          ability to freehand draw and create graphics with this program made it
          the top program of its kind during 1984. The earlier versions of the
          program were called MacSketch and LisaSketch, and the last version of
          MacPaint was MacPaint 2.0 released in 1998. Much of MacPaint’s
          universal success was attributed to the release of the first Macintosh
          computer which was equipped with one other program called MacWrite.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          It was the first personal computer with a graphical user interface and
          lost much of the bulky size of its predecessor, the Lisa. The
          Macintosh was available at about $2500 and the combination of a
          smaller design made the computer a hit, exposing the average computer
          user to the graphical possibilities of the included MacPaint. Another
          early image manipulation program was Adobe Photoshop. It was first
          called Display and was created in 1987 by Thomas Knoll at the
          University of Michigan as monochrome picture display program. With
          help from his brother John, the program was turned into an image
          editing program called Imagepro, but later changed to Photoshop. The
          Knolls agreed on a deal with Adobe systems and Apple, and Photoshop
          1.0 was released in 1991 for Macintosh.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mph3" id="Section-4">Section 4</h3>
        <p class="mpp">
          Adobe systems had previously release Adobe Illustrator 1.0 in 1986 on
          the Apple Macintosh. These two programs, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe
          Illustrator are currently two of the top programs used in the
          productions of digital paintings. Illustrator introduced the uses of
          Bezier curves which allowed the user to be incredibly detailed in
          their vector drawings. In 1988, Craig Hickman created a paint program
          called Kid Pix, which made it easier for children to use MacPaint. The
          program was originally created in black in white, and after several
          revisions was released in color in 1991. Kid Pix was one of the first
          commercial programs to integrate color and sound in a creative format.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          While the Kid Pix was intentionally created for children, it became a
          useful tool for introducing adults to the computer as well. In recent
          years there has been a growth in the websites which support painting
          digitally online. Internet resources for this include Sumo Paint and
          Queeky. The user is still drawing digitally with the use of software:
          often the software is on the server of the website which is being
          used. However with the emergence of html5, some programs now partly
          use the client’s web browser to handle some of the processing. The
          range of tools and brushes can be more limited than free standing
          software. Speed of response, quality of colour and the ability to save
          to a file or print are similar in either media.
        </p>
        <p class="mpp">
          Digitally painted images allow the choice of viewing on screen, or
          simply printed on paper for display. Other benefits include. It has
          had a large impact on speed painting. Each stroke of the painting
          process can be captured for later replay and study. Tools and
          resources are easy to access on the internet, so that anyone can
          learn. It makes it easy to learn to paint and to progress to ‘real’
          painting.
        </p>

          Computer art is any art in which computers play a role in production
          or display of the artwork. Such art can be an image, sound, animation,
          video, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, videogame, web site, algorithm, performance or
          gallery installation.
